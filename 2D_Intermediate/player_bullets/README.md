# 2D - PLAYER BULLETS

Demonstrates how to create player bullets that will travel to a point determined by a mouse click on screen. This method works with a camera, using the screen to world position of the mouse click therefore the zoom can be changed. The player can move and the bullets will be destroyed when hitting the border rectangle. This can be used for both player bullets as well as enemy bullets, for enemy bullets the mouse click center point is substituted with the player center. WASD keys move player, left mouse button to shoot and up arrow key to change zoom. View more at [unklnik.com](https://unklnik.com/)
