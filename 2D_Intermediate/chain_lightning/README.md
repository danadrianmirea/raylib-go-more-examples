# 2D - CHAIN LIGHTNING
Demonstrates a simple method to create an effect of chain lightning, when one rectangle (enemy) is impacted by a bullet rectangle then a chain of lines is drawn between the centers of all enemies on screen. WASD keys move player, left mouse button to shoot and up arrow key to change zoom. The [Player Bullets](https://github.com/unklnik/raylib-go-more-examples/tree/main/2D_Intermediate/player_bullets) example can be used a starting point for this example.
