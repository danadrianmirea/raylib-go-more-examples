# 2D - MOVING POLYGON TRIANGLES

Makes use of *rl.DrawPoly* to create a line of moving triangles - change direction using the **W A S D keys**. This is the easier method, as opposed to using *rl.DrawTriangle*, as you do not have to recalculate the Vector2 points on direction change. The change direction movement is rough and could definitely be improved however it demonstrates the usage. View more at [unklnik.com](https://unklnik.com/posts/2d-moving-triangles/)
