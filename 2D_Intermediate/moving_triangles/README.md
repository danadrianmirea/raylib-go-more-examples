# 2D - MOVING POLYGON TRIANGLES
Makes of of rl.DrawPoly to create a line of moving triangles that can be moved using the W A S D keys. This is the easier method, as opposed to using rl.DrawTriangle, as you do not have to recalculate the Vector2 points on direction change. The change direction movement is rough and could definitely be improved however it demonstrates the usage.
