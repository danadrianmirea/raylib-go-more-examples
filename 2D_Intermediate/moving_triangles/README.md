# 2D - MOVING POLYGON TRIANGLES
Makes of of **rl.DrawPoly** to create a line of moving triangles - change direction using the W A S D keys. This is the easier method, as opposed to using **rl.DrawTriangle**, as you do not have to recalculate the Vector2 points on direction change. The change direction movement is rough and could definitely be improved however it demonstrates the usage.
