# 2D - MOVE TO POINT WITH COLLISIONS
This demonstrates how to move a player (or other object) to a point as determined by clicking on the screen. Left mouse click on the screen and the green rectangle will move to the point, recalculating X & Y directions as it moves therefore moving smoothly. If the player (green rectangle) collides with a blue block it will adjust movement accordingly, however, note that this does not find paths. This will purely stop either X or Y, or both, movement directions, dependent on the angle of movement. This example is based on the previous example [Move to Point](https://github.com/unklnik/raylib-go-more-examples/tree/main/2D_Intermediate/move_to_point) which does not take collisions into account which can be used as a starting point to complete this example.
