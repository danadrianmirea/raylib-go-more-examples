# Additional Examples for Raylib Go
A compilation of examples of how to use the Go bindings for Raylib (https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go). This is intended as a resource to learn some basic Raylib and Go game dev skills. If you want to use any of the code anywhere else, feel free to do so. I am a self taught Go programmer and do it as a hobby, the code here is my own interpretation of how to do something, probably not the only way or the best way. If you have any suggestions or spot any errors then please let me know.
