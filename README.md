# Additional Examples for Raylib Go
A compilation of examples on how to use the Go bindings for Raylib (https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go).

This is intended as a resource to help beginners learn some basic Raylib and Go game dev skills. If you want to use any of the code anywhere else, feel free to do so. 

If you need help and don't know already the [Raylib Cheatsheet](https://www.raylib.com/cheatsheet/cheatsheet.html) is useful, just note that this is intended for programming in C (not Go) however it is a good resource for finding Raylib functions.

*I am a self taught Go programmer and do it as a hobby, the code here is my own interpretation of how to do something, probably not the only way or the best way. If you have any suggestions or spot any errors then please let me know.*
