# 2D - TILED DUNGEON MAP WITH PLAYER
Demonstrates how to create a simple dungeon map of room rectangles for use in top-down games. This expands on the [Simple Dungeon Map Example](https://github.com/unklnik/raylib-go-more-examples/tree/main/2D_Intermediate/simple_dungeon_map) which should be used as a starting point. Creates random dungeons and then tiles the floors and walls and adds a player that moves and is animated. W A S D keys move player, SPACE to make a new map, UP ARROW to change the camera zoom, RIGHT ARROW to turn colors on/off and DOWN ARROW to turn on/off debug mode. Every map will be different from the next map and you can change the number of rooms and map size easily to allow for creation of larger or smaller maps. This is used as the base for a more advanced tutorial with image tiling and players. View more at [unklnik.com](https://unklnik.com/)
