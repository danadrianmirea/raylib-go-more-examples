# 2D BEGINNER EXAMPLES
These examples are intended for anyone that is just starting to get into games programming, the basics of using Raylib and Go to create simple things. These are very easy and help you better understand how Raylib works if you haven't used it. Read the comments if you are not sure what the code is doing. These examples are very basic building blocks that will allow you to create more complex things as you progress.
