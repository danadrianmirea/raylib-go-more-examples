[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/E1E5YOJH1)

Easy way of creating some movement in your background if you are making a space game. Uses rectangles, color fade, random movement and a direction change timer. If you want to use sprites (images) instead then change the rectangles to textures. View more at [unklnik.com](https://unklnik.com/posts/2d-moving-space-background/)
